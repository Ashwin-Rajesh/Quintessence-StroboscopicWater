# Quintessence-StroboscopicWater

Quintessence is the annual techfest organised by Department of ECE, Government engineering college, Thrissur. 

This is a small project made for the same, which creates the illusion of standing or slowly rising or falling water drops suspended in the air by using LED strips that light up periodically which are synchronised with solenoid valves that create water drops at a certain frequency. Changing relative frequency of creating drops with that of LED blinking will create the effect of rising or falling water.
